# Solar power generation endpoints

There are three API endpoints for retreiving the amount of energy generated by Tesla solar panels:

| Endpoint            | Description                                                    |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `history`           | Returns statistics for the previous day, week, month, or year. |
| `calendar_history`  | Returns statistics for a selected period in the past.          |
| `telemetry_history` | No information available.                                      |

The statistics can either be instantaneous power generation in watts at 15 minute intervals for a day, or cumulative energy in kWh generated in a day, week, month, or year. Depending on your equipment, some statistics may be unsupported and always return 0.  

All APIs have the same URL component `{site_id}`, so a description of that component is not repeated in the API details below.  The Site ID identifies your solar installation. See the README.md file in this folder for information on how to obtain your Site ID.

The example responses below are pretty-printed for easier readability.  The actual responses are sent as a compact single line, with no spaces, tabs, or newlines.



## GET `/api/1/energy_sites/{site_id}/history`

There are two distinct usages of the `history` endpoint: one to retrieve power generation (watts) for the previous day, and one to retrieve energy generation (kWh) for a specified period.


### Request parameters for usage #1:

| Field   | Type             | Example | Description                                           |
| :------ | :--------------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`  | String, required | `power` | The value `power` selects power statistics, in watts. |


### Request parameters for usage #2:

| Field    | Type             | Example                           | Description                                           |
| :------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`   | String, required | `energy`                          | The value `energy` selects energy statistics, in kWh. |
| `period` | String, required | `day`, `week`, `month`, or `year` | The time span for statistics to cover.                |

The `period` value determines the number and time span of the retrieved data items:

| Value          | Statistics returned                                                        |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `day`          | Total kWh for yesterday, and for today up to the current time.             |
| `week`         | Total kWh for each of the past 7 days, not including today.                |
| `month`        | Total kWh for each of the past 4 weeks, not including the current week.<br>Weeks are Sunday to Saturday; timestamps are for Saturdays. |
| `year`         | Total kWh for each of the past 12 months, not including the current month. |



### Response for usage #1:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "serial_number": "313dbc37-555c-45b1-83aa-62a4ef9ff7ac",
    "time_series": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2022-05-13T00:00:00-07:00",
        "solar_power": 0,
        "battery_power": 0,
        "grid_power": 0,
        "grid_services_power": 0,
        "generator_power": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `solar_power` value is the power being generated, in watts, at the given timestamp. To save space, only the first entry is shown in the `time_series` array. In a real response, there are many entries in the array: one entry for each 15 minutes, starting at the beginning (midnight) of the previous day and ending at the current time and day.  The entries cover 24 - 48 hours, depending on when the request is made. Depending on your equipment, some nighttime samples may be omitted if they are all zeroes.


### Response for usage #2:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "serial_number": "313dbc37-555c-45b1-83aa-62a4ef9ff7ac",
    "period": "week",
    "time_series": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2022-05-09T01:00:00-07:00",
        "solar_energy_exported": 18630,
        "generator_energy_exported": 0,
        "grid_energy_imported": 0,
        "grid_services_energy_imported": 0,
        "grid_services_energy_exported": 0,
        "grid_energy_exported_from_solar": 0,
        "grid_energy_exported_from_generator": 0,
        "grid_energy_exported_from_battery": 0,
        "battery_energy_exported": 0,
        "battery_energy_imported_from_grid": 0,
        "battery_energy_imported_from_solar": 0,
        "battery_energy_imported_from_generator": 0,
        "consumer_energy_imported_from_grid": 0,
        "consumer_energy_imported_from_solar": 0,
        "consumer_energy_imported_from_battery": 0,
        "consumer_energy_imported_from_generator": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `solar_energy_exported` value is the energy generated by the solar panels, in kWh.  To save space, only the first entry is shown in the `time_series` array. In a real response, there are multiple entries in the array, depending on the value of the `period` parameter.  For example, if the `period` value is `week`, there are 7 entries, each one representing the energy generated for one day.



## GET `/api/1/energy_sites/{site_id}/calendar_history`

There are two distinct usages of the `calendar_history` endpoint: one to retrieve power generation (watts) at 15-minute intervals for a given day, and one to retrieve energy generation (kWh) for a specified period.


### Request parameters for usage #1:

| Field      | Type             | Example                     | Description                                                     |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`     | String, required | `power`                     | The value `power` selects power statistics, in watts.           |
| `end_date` | String, required | `2022-04-29T14:15:00-07:00` | Specifies the day for which the power statistics are retrieved. |

The format for the `end_date` parameter value is "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss-hh:mm".  Specify your local time zone offset for best clarity.  Universal time is accepted in the format "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ", but the time is converted to your local time zone, which could also change the date.


### Request parameters for usage #2:

| Field      | Type             | Example                                       | Description                                                          |
| :--------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`     | String, required | `energy`                                      | The value `energy` selects energy statistics, in kWh.                |
| `end_date` | String, required | `2022-04-29T14:15:00-07:00`                   | Specifies the last day for which the power statistics are retrieved. |
| `period`   | String, required | `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`, or `lifetime` | The time span for statistics to cover.                               |

The `period` value determines the number and time span of the retrieved data items:

| Value          | Statistics returned                                                                        |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `day`          | Total kWh for the day specified by `end_date`.                                             |
| `week`         | Total kWh for each day from the previous Monday to, and including, `end_date`.             |
| `month`        | Total kWh for each day from the first of the month to, and including,`end_date`.           |
| `year`         | Total kWh for each calendar month from the previous January to, and including, `end_date`. |
| `lifetime`     | Total kWh for each calendar year from installation to, and including, `end_date`.          |

The handling of partial periods is a bit inconsistent at this time.  If `end_date` specifies a time in the middle of the day, then statistics for a partial day are reported when `period=day`, but statistics for the entire day are reported when `period=week` or `period=month`. For `period=year` or `period=lifetime`, an `end_date` in mid-month or mid-year returns statistics for a partial month or partial year.



### Response for usage #1:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "serial_number": "313dbc37-555c-45b1-83aa-62a4ef9ff7ac",
    "time_zone_offset": -420,
    "time_series": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2022-04-29T00:00:00-07:00",
        "solar_power": 0,
        "battery_power": 0,
        "grid_power": 0,
        "grid_services_power": 0,
        "generator_power": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `solar_power` value is the power being generated, in watts, at the given timestamp. To save space, only the first entry is shown in the `time_series` array. In a real response, there is one entry for each 15 minutes, starting at the beginning (midnight) of the specified date and ending at the specified time.  To retrieve a full day's records, specify an ending time after sunset, or 23:45:00.  Don't use 00:00:00 for the time, or you'll retrieve an empty list.

        "consumer_energy_imported_from_generator": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`solar_energy_exported` is the energy generated by the solar panels, in kWh.  To save space only the first entry in the `time_series` array is shown. In a real response, the number of entries in the array depends on the `period` and `end_date` values.  Timestamps in the response represent the start of a period; e.g., monthly statistics for February show a date of February 1st in the timestamp, and daily statistics for February 15th show a timestamp of 1:00 AM on February 15th.
