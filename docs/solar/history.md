# Solar power generation endpoints

There are three API endpoints for retreiving the amount of energy generated by Tesla solar panels:

| Endpoint            | Description                                                    |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `history`           | Returns statistics for the previous day, week, month, or year. |
| `calendar_history`  | Returns statistics for a selected period in the past.          |
| `telemetry_history` | No information available.                                      |

The statistics can either be instantaneous power generation in watts at 15 minute intervals for a day, or cumulative energy in kWh generated in a day, week, month, or year. Depending on your equipment, some statistics may be unsupported and always return 0.  

All APIs have the same URL parameter `site_id`, so a description of that parameter is not repeated in the API details below.  The `site_id` identifies your solar installation. See the README.md file in this folder for information on how to obtain your `site_id`.



## GET `/api/1/energy_sites/{site_id}/history?kind=power`

Retrieve the most recent power generation statistics, in watts, recorded at 15 minute intervals.

### Request parameters

| Field   | Value   | Description                                           |
| :------ | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`  | `power` | The value "power" selects power statistics, in watts. |

The `solar_power` field is the power being generated, in watts, at the given timestamp. The time series includes a sample every 15 minutes, starting at the beginning (midnight) of the previous day and ending at the current time and day.  The statistics cover 24 - 48 hours, depending on when the request is made. Depending on your equipment, nighttime samples may be omitted if they are all zeroes.



## GET `/api/1/energy_sites/{site_id}/history?kind=energy&period=xxx`

Retrieve the most recent energy generation statistics, in kWh, for the period specified.

### Request parameters

| :------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`   | `energy`                          | The value "energy" selects energy statistics, in kWh. |
| `period` | `day`, `week`, `month`, or `year` | The time span for statistics to cover.                |

| `period` value | Statistics returned                                                        |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `day`          | Total kWh for yesterday, and for today up to the current time.             |
| `week`         | Total kWh for each of the past 7 days, not including today.                |
| `month`        | Total kWh for each of the past 4 weeks, not including the current week.<br>Weeks are Sunday to Saturday; timestamps are for Saturdays. 
| `year`         | Total kWh for each of the past 12 months, not including the current month. |
